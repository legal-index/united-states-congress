# improving legislative efficiency

```
stop me if you heard this one...
george washington walks into a room full of information scientists
and realizes he has no idea what hes talking about
```

### problem

1. the 18th century legislative process is too inefficient for the 21st century
1. the law currently available in html on https://uscode.house.gov/ is slow, does not include a history of changes and lacks the feature of linking lines
1. the public has 0 evidence proving members of the senate and house of representatives are personally contributing to the law
1. the public pays members of the senate and house of representatives annual salaries without measuring their output
1. silent productive leaders are forced to waste time talking as least as much as money soliciting campaigners

### solution

1. raise funding to migrate all law to git, e.g. migrate html united states code on https://uscode.house.gov/ to this repo
1. migrate law to git with funded and volunteer labor
1. issue git accounts to members of the senate and house of representatives
1. train members of the senate and house of representatives on git
1. require all changes to law as pull requests in git
1. require public merge negotiations in pull requests to enforce judging matters strictly on their merits, free from [vote trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_trading)
1. pull requests are merged to `enacted` branch
1. add a performance measuring tool similar to [flow](https://www.pluralsight.com/product/flow) to repos in org
1. switch members of the senate and house of representatives from annual to hourly compensation
1. require members of the senate and house of representatives to record hourly output in a time tracker app similar to [toggl](https://toggl.com/), but with public reporting available
1. measure and publish personal hourly contribution of members of the senate and house of representatives to law
1. measure and publish fiscal performance per contribution to inform elections with empirical data
1. reveal hard working and capable legislators by allowing non members of the senate and house of representatives to create pull requests
1. promote production and consideration of empirical data by extending the law forbidding campaigns near ballot boxes to everywhere, all the time (neglecting facts by allowing the competitively funded broadcast of fiction is more costly, and harder to recover from, than a failure to produce and research facts)
1. outlaw campaign funding to eliminate campaign funding competition of initiatives not explicitly covered by campaign ban
1. add `united-states-president` repo
1. add `united-states-supreme-court` repo
1. issue org access to state and local governments
1. issue org access to other countries
1. empower everyone to find law in one place
1. empower everyone to cite law from one place
1. encourage law to be written in a lanugage where enforcement is automated, e.g. typescript
1. reduce cost of law enforcement through code

# improving legislative efficiency

### problem

1. the 18th century legislative process is too inefficient for the 21st century
1. the law currently available in html on https://uscode.house.gov/ is slow, does not include a history of changes and lacks the feature of linking lines
1. the public has 0 evidence proving members of the senate and house of representatives are personally contributing to the law
1. the public pays members of the senate and house of representatives annual salaries without measuring their output

### solution

1. raise funding to migrate all law to git, e.g. migrate html united states code on https://uscode.house.gov/ to this repo
1. migrate law to git
1. add a performance measuring tool similar to [flow](https://www.pluralsight.com/product/flow) to repos in org
1. switch members of the senate and house of representatives from annual to hourly compensation
1. require members of the senate and house of representatives to record hourly output in time tracker app similar to [toggl](https://toggl.com/), but with public reporting available
1. issue git accounts to members of the senate and house of representatives
1. train members of the senate and house of representatives on git
1. require all changes to law as pull requests in git
1. require public merge negotiations in pull requests
1. pull requests are merged to `enacted` branch
1. measure personal hourly contribution of members of the senate and house of representatives to law
1. measure fiscal performance per contribution
1. add `united-states-president` repo
1. add `united-states-supreme-court` repo
1. issue org access to state and local governments
1. issue org access to other countries
1. empower everyone to find law in one place
